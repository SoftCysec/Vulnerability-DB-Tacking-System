# **Vulnerability Database and Tracking System**

Welcome to the Vulnerability Database and Tracking System. This application allows users to track vulnerabilities, access resources, and more.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.8 or higher is recommended)
- pip
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

## Setting Up the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/SoftCysec/Vulnerability-DB-Tacking-System.git
cd Vulnerability-DB-Tacking-System
```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
Setting up a virtual environment will ensure that the dependencies of the project don't interfere with your global Python environment.

```
python -m venv venv
```
- **Activate the Virtual Environment**
  - On Windows:
    ```
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS and Linux:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```


3. **Install Required Packages**

With the virtual environment activated (if you're using one), install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. **Database Migrations**

Apply migrations to set up the database schema:
```
python manage.py migrate
```


5. **Create Superuser (Optional)**

If you want to access the Django admin panel, you'll need a superuser account:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.



6. **Run the Development Server**

Start the development server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
Once the server is running, open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the application.


## Features

- **User Registration & Profile Management**
- **Vulnerability Tracking**
- **Resources**

## Accessing the Admin Panel

With a superuser account created, you can access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` using the superuser credentials.
